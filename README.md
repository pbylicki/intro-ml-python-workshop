# Introduction to Machine Learning in Python

## Environment setup

### Windows

Install Python 3. You can download newest version 3.6 from https://www.python.org/downloads/ if you still don't have Python 3 installed.

Install the following packages: (If you already have them, make sure they are up-to-date)

Install NumPy and Pandas packages by typing in terminal: 
```
pip install pandas
```

To install SciPy and Scikit-learn packages download .whl files matching your Python version from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

For Python 3.6 download _scipy‑0.19.0‑cp36‑cp36m‑win32.whl_ from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#scipy

and _scikit_learn‑0.18.1‑cp36‑cp36m‑win32.whl_ from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#scikit-learn

Open terminal in directory where both files are located and install SciPy first:
```
pip install scipy‑0.19.0‑cp36‑cp36m‑win32.whl
```

and next Scikit-learn:
```
pip install scikit_learn‑0.18.1‑cp36‑cp36m‑win32.whl
```

Install Matplotlib package:
```
pip install matplotlib
```

Install Jupyter package:
```
pip install jupyter
```

Install Folium package:
```
pip install folium
```

To launch Jupyter Notebook open terminal in your working directory and type:
```
jupyter notebook
```

Jupyter should open in browser window, now you can start to create, edit and execute your notebooks and other files.
